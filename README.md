### ‚úèÔ∏è Description 
Codecademy Virtual Reality (CVR), Inc. is the latest startup on the VR scene. As head of the Project Completion team, you have been given a list of upcoming projects needing to be delivered. Your main responsibility is to analyze our current talent pool to ensure each project can be completed efficiently and effectively.

When employees are hired at CVR, they are given the Myers-Briggs personality test. We try to diminish tension among team members by creating teams based on compatible personalities. The chart shows which personality matches should be avoided. For example, an employee with the ISFP personality type should¬†not¬†be matched with an INFP, ENFP, or an INFJ.
